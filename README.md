# ABC-Jobs
Academic Project

Using the struts framework, I designed an ABC Jobs Community portal. This portal resembles the linkedin website in appearance.
On the Registration Page, users will be able to register for the portal. Users of the site can look up other users by entering their first and last names, company name, city, and country. 
After searching for users, users will be able to see their Public profiles. Users may log in, reset their passwords, and update their profile information using the site. In addition, the database will be arranged to contain all of the 
registered user's data. Where the administrator has access to all user information and has the ability to delete or update users.
